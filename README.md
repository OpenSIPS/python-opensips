# OpenSIPS Python Packages

This repository contains a collection of Python packages for OpenSIPS. These modules are designed to be as lightweight as possible and provide a simple interface for interacting with OpenSIPS.

## Features

Currently, the following packages are available:
- `mi` - can be used to execute OpenSIPS Management Interface (MI) commands.
- `event` - allows you to use OpenSIPS Event Interface subscriptions.

## Usage

1. Install the package from source code:
    
    ```bash
    git clone
    cd python-opebsips
    pip install .
    ```

2. Import the package in your Python code:

    ```python
    from opensips.mi import OpenSIPSMI, OpenSIPSMIException
    from opensips.event import OpenSIPSEvent, OpenSIPSEventException
    ```

3. Use the methods provided by the modules:

    ```python
    mi = OpenSIPSMI('http', url='http://localhost:8888/mi')
    try:
        response = mi.execute('ps')
        # do something with the response
    except OpenSIPSMIException as e:
        # handle the exception
    ```

    ```python
    mi_connector = OpenSIPSMI('http', url='http://localhost:8888/mi')
    event = OpenSIPSEvent(mi_connector, 'datagram', ip='127.0.0.1', port=50012)

    def some_callback(message):
        # do something with the message
        pass

    try:
        event.subscribe('E_PIKE_BLOCKED', some_callback)
    except OpenSIPSEventException as e:
        # handle the exception

    try:
        event.unsubscribe('E_PIKE_BLOCKED')
    except OpenSIPSEventException as e:
        # handle the exception
    ```

## Documentation

* [MI](docs/mi.md) - contains information about supported MI communication types and required parameters for each type.
* [Event Interface](docs/event.md) - lists the supported event transport protocols and provides information about the required parameters for each protocol.

## Scripts

After installing the package, you can use the provided [opensips-mi](scripts/opensips-mi) script to run MI commands. This script takes the following arguments:
- `-t` or `--type` - the type of the MI communication ()`http` or `datagram`)
- `-i` or `--ip` - the IP address of the OpenSIPS server.
- `-p` or `--port` - the port of the OpenSIPS MI.

#### Usage
```bash
# general usage
opensips-mi -t datagram -p 8080 command_name [command_args ...]

# this will execute get_statistics command
opensips-mi -t datagram -p 8080 -s core: shmem:

# you can pass json string as argument with -j flag for commands that require arrays as arguments
opensips-mi -t datagram -p 8080 get_statistics -j "{'statistics': ['core:', 'shmem:']}"
```
