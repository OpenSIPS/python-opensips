Description:  A collection of Python packages for OpenSIPS.
 These modules are designed to be as lightweight as possible and provide a
 simple interface for interacting with OpenSIPS.
 .
 OpenSIPS is a very fast and flexible SIP (RFC3261)
 server. Written entirely in C, OpenSIPS can handle thousands of calls
 per second even on low-budget hardware.
 .
 C Shell-like scripting language provides full control over the server's
 behaviour. Its modular architecture allows only required functionality to be
 loaded.
 .
 Among others, the following modules are available: Digest Authentication, CPL
 scripts, Instant Messaging, MySQL/PostgreSQL support, Presence Agent, Radius
 Authentication, Record Routing, SMS Gateway, Jabber/XMPP Gateway, Transaction
 Module, SIP Registrar and User Location, Load Balancing/Dispatching/LCR,
